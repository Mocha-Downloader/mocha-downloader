You can search for existing feature suggestions in the [issues page](https://github.com/Mocha-Downloader/mocha-downloader/issues?q=label%3Aenhancement).
If someone has already submitted a feature suggestion, feel free to leave a comment **IF it adds new information to the table**.
Do not leave comments like "+1" or "We need this". Instead, simply leave a :thumbsup: reaction to the original feature suggestion.

Delete this section of the template before submitting.
Non removal of this section **WILL** get your issue closed without a warning or explanation assuming that you haven't read the warning.
