## BEFORE SUBMITTING

Before submitting a feature suggestion, make sure that no one else has made the same one before.
You can search for existing feature suggestions in the [issues page](https://github.com/Mocha-Downloader/mocha-downloader/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22feature+request%22).
If someone has already submitted a feature suggestion, feel free to leave a comment **IF it adds new information to the table**.
Do not leave comments like "+1" or "We need this". Instead, simply leave a :thumbsup: reaction to the original feature suggestion.

Delete this section of the template before submitting.
Non removal of this section **WILL** get your issue closed without a warning or explanation assuming that you haven't read the warning.
