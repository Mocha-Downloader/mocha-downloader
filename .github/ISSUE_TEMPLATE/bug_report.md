**BEFORE SUBMITTING**

Before submitting a bug report, make sure that no one else has made the same one before.
You can search for existing issues in the [issues page](https://github.com/Mocha-Downloader/mocha-downloader/issues?q=label%3Abug).
If someone has already opened a issue, feel free to leave a comment **IF it adds new information to the table**.
Also, do not leave comments like "+1" or "I have the same issue". Instead, simply leave a :thumbsup: reaction to the original bug report.

Delete this section of the template before submitting.
Non removal of this section **WILL** get your issue closed without a warning or explanation assuming that you haven't read the warning.
