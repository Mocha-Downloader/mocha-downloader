## BEFORE SUBMITTING

Before asking a question, make sure that no one else has asked the same question before.
You can search for existing questions in the [issues page](https://github.com/Mocha-Downloader/mocha-downloader/issues?q=label%3Aquestion).
If someone has already asked the same question, feel free to leave a comment **IF it adds new information to the table**.
Do not leave comments like "+1" or "I have the same question". Instead, simply leave a :thumbsup: reaction to the original question.

Also, keep in mind that you are not just asking for yourself but for other everyone who comes after you so please make the question short, concise, and on point.

Delete this section of the template before submitting.
Non removal of this section **WILL** get your issue closed without a warning or explanation assuming that you haven't read the warning.
